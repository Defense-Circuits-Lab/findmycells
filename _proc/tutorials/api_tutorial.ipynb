    "- optional: a complementary ROI file for each image that specifies the area(s) of interest in your image that shall be quantified (check out the guide in the [GUI tutorial](https://defense-circuits-lab.github.io/findmycells/tutorials/gui_tutorial.html))\n",

This tutorial will also not cover all available options, and is rather intended to give you a rough idea of how to interact with the API."
